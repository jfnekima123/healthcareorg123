    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Integrated services are health services that are managed and delivered so that people receive a continuum of health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, disease-management, rehabilitation and palliative care services, coordinated across the different levels and sites of care within and beyond the health sector, and according to their needs throughout the life course. <br>

      People-centred health services is an approach to care that consciously adopts the perspectives of individuals, families and communities, and sees them as participants as well as beneficiaries of trusted health systems that respond to their needs and preferences in humane and holistic ways.  <br>


More than 90 percent of participants were ages 45 to 79. In this age.......      </p>

      <h3><b >Integrated emergency, critical and operative care </b></h3>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Emergency, critical and operative care (ECO) represent a people-centred continuum. Integrated people-centred service delivery requires ECO services that are linked to communities through primary care by communication, transportation, referral and counter-referral mechanisms.</p>
<br>Operative care is understood to span both anaesthesia and surgery services in theatres and ambulatory centres, while surgeons and anaesthesia professionals may deliver emergency, critical and operative care, including obstetric care, as part of comprehensive peri-operative care and beyond. Emergency and critical care may be delivered in an ambulance or in an emergency unit, an intensive care unit or a theatre by technicians, nurses or specialist doctors. Nurses deliver as much emergency care around the world as doctors, and both may be trained as specialists of the first hours of care.
   <br>This resolution, co-sponsored by over 80 Member States, represents a powerful call for near-term action to strengthen health systems for delivery of high-quality emergency, critical and operative care. It builds on, expands and reactivates the mandates of previous resolutions, including WHA60.22 on Health Systems: emergency care systems, WHA68.15 on strengthening emergency and essential surgical care and anaesthesia as a component of universal health coverage and WHA72.16 on Emergency care systems for universal health coverage: ensuring timely care for the acutely ill and injured. <br> </p></p>
